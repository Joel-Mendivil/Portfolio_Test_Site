                <p>Mario is a fictional character in the <em>Mario</em>
                video game franchise, owned by Nintendo and created by
                Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. Acting as
                the company's mascot, as well as being the protagonist of the
                series, Mario has appeared in over 200 video games since his creation.
                Depicted as a short, pudgy, Italian plumber who resides in the Mushroom
                Kingdom, his adventures generally center upon rescuing Princess Peach from the
                Koopa villian Bowser. His faternal twin brother and sidekick is Luigi.</p>

            <p>Luigi is a fictional character featured in video games and related media released by

            throughout the <em>Mario</em> franchise, often as a sidekick to his older brother.</p>
