            <h2>Speed</h2>
             <p>
                Massively FTL+ (Keeps up with Bowser, who can tag Starship Mario with his meteors, which is able to cross entire universes in ten seconds, and universes are 91 billion lightyears across; this makes Mario 287,174,160,000,156,544 times faster than light. Bowser can also keep up with the Mini-Stars, which began traveling the universe to reach their placement in it, which is easily this speed. He can keep up with Dreamy Luigi, who leaped out into a constellation in less than a second, which is 137,748,925 times faster than light. Mario also defeated the Millennium Star, which flew from the center of the universe to Earth in a couple of seconds. Mario is also consistently this fast) | Superhuman (This is the highest speed he's displayed) w/ Massively FTL+ reactions (Despite zooming through an asteroid field and across the universe at a crash-landing speed, he could still catch sight of Mouser, meaning he could see and react at such speeds) | Unknown | Sub-Relativistic+ (Capable of moving and interacting when at a distance from a large black hole. While he was definitely not behind the event horizon, light still gets bent and affected at that distance, so Mario moving at all is still around this level of speed) w/ Relativistic+ reactions and combat speed (Capable of dodging White Mages's specials, which are literal columns of light. Also reacted perfectly fine while racing around Saturn's rings. Since they can race along the E Ring, the furthest ring from Saturn, equating to a distance of 3-8 Saturn radii, and since Saturn's circumference is 227,350.77715498615708106457636117 miles [using its radius and converting it to circumference], then we multiply the result by 8x to get the furthest point of the E Ring. That is 1,818,806.2172398892566485166108894 miles. Since they cover the entire thing in 14 seconds, we divide the distance by the time, and that means they were going at exactly 129,914.7298028492326177511864921 miles per second. Light moves at 186,282 miles per second, so they were moving at roughly 0.69740744084975148098c, or around 70% of the speed of light, which makes them this speed) | Immeasurable (Bowser was traversing all of Dream Depot and wiping out each dream one by one--which are universes--casually, as evidenced by how he's talking about his plan and such, before destroying Dream Depot itself. Misstar then says "at this rate, he'll destroy the dream worlds one by one." She goes on to say that Mario must protect everyone's dreams. This means Bowser was casually moving at a rate that would allow him to destroy an uncountable set of uncountably infinite universes. Not only does Mario fight Bowser in this game, but during the story, he's actively chasing Bowser through Dream Depot, so Mario accomplished a toned down version of this feat. Even so, he still scales to the full thing for being a touch faster than Bowser) | Massively Hypersonic (His jumps are faster than Lakithunder's lightning) | Massively FTL+ (Keeps up with Bowser in both Galaxy games. And in SMG2, Bowser tagged Starship Mario with his meteors. Starship Mario can travel entire worlds, which are entire universes, as Lubba states that you must travel through space-time in order to reach unknown worlds. Starship Mario crosses said universes, going from one side to the other, in ten seconds. It takes 91 billion lightyears to do that in reality, so, Mario can travel and fight with speeds that cross 9.1 billion lightyears every second, and can react at such a speed. This makes Mario 287,174,160,000,156,544 times faster than light. With something like the speed quadrupling Rainbow Star, Mario would be 1,148,696,640,000,626,176 times faster than light) to Infinite (Can move within the dimensional rift between each Secret Level. These aren't pre-destined rifts, either, as Shadow Mario left and never appeared in the Secret Level with Mario. With that said, this must have been a white, empty rift that Mario and Shadow Mario moved through on their own. The background moving was only because the two Marios were moving, evidenced by their blurs, so this was indeed an empty rift. Also, in Tick Tock Clock, the progression of time is dependent on when you enter the world. Entering at 12 o'clock stops time completely, yet Mario can still move freely in this state) | At least FTL (Outran Giant Bowser, who escaped a black hole. Also accomplished this) to Massively FTL+ (Scales to Dreamy Bowser, who scales to Antasma, who scales to Dreamy Luigi, who jumped out into the Sun in 1 second. The distance between the Earth and the Sun is 92,960,000 miles. Crossing that distance in that time is 334,656,000,000mph, or 499.0272912069 speeds of light. Dreamy Luigi could also jump into constellations, which takes MFTL+ speed--more specifically a few lightyears per second of speed--to accomplish within such a small time frame), likely Infinite (Fought and easily kept up with Culex, and Culex is the Master of Time and Space, and can consume time. Thus, timeless voids would be his natural environment. He also holds time from its beginning to its end, and during his fight, he was crossing between dimensions. It's actually stated in the Japanese version he was within a dimensional rift, and those are, by definition, devoid of time and space. Furthermore, he was about to leave Mario's and go back to Vanda--thus, he was in between dimensions at the time. Meaning, he was outside of the space-time continuum--which all qualifies for infinite speed. Mario also had his speed complimented by the Zeekeeper, and can also keep up with him and Giant Dreamy Luigi, as well as characters equal to or faster than Zeekeeper. Zeekeeper can tear a dimensional rift. Rifts are, again, by definition, absent of time and space. Zeekeeper is fully capable of moving inside of them, which gives him infinite speed. And as said, Mario definitely scales to this) | Immeasurable (Super Dimentio exists in this verse too, and his goal was the same: to nuke existence. Since he'd nuke all existence--all time and time periods--traveling all across time, and all of space, and moved in The Void--which is what was erasing said existence--the characters should be this level of speed) | Unknown. Higher w/ the power of wishes | Massively FTL+ (Far superior to Lord Crump, who returned from being blasted out into deep space, far past even the moon, within, at absolute worst, a few hours) | Immeasurable w/ or w/o the Pure Hearts (The Void consumes all existence--all worlds, all dimensions, all timelines, all possibilities. This means it nukes all of time and space, and The Void itself destroys all of time and space at all time periods, as well. The Void is definitely rather of higher dimensional order, as it's not even under the conventional aspects of "near" and "far," and it's actively capable of existing all throughout time and space; and since it erases stuff above time in all aspects, it should naturally be into these areas. The characters actively resist The Void dozens of times, and should scale off of it), possibly Irrelevant | Unknown | Massively FTL+ (The Black Paint spreaded across all the space of the universe rather quickly, and CS Paper Mario could keep up with it in combat, so he should scale)

                Superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes and durability, Enhanced Unarmed Combat, Dimensional Storage, Pyrokinesis, Minor Electrokinesis and Aerokinesis, Energy Manipulation, Danger Sensing (His nose can apparently smell trouble), Limited Physics Manipulation (His jumps' physics are impossible for Isaac Newton to understand), Longevity (In the Super Mario Galaxy games, Mario has witnessed two Star Festivals, which take place once every 100 years. Comparable to Peach and Bowser, who would live on for 10,000 more years after Bowser created his own universe), Shapeshifting (Has transformed into others before), Flight (Achieved flight once), Plot Manipulation (Broke manga panels with his presence), Telekinesis (Can change the direction of Megavitamins mid-flight), Plant Growth Acceleration (Has invented a specific Megavitamin to accelerate plant growth), Resistance to Gravity Manipulation (Can walk perfectly fine on hundreds of different sized planets in different galaxies across different universes and can even walk near black holes), Resistance to Radiation Manipulation (Immune to Hawking Radiation), Resistance to Petrification (Can break free from being turned to stone), Resistance to Existence Erasure (Unaffected by Bowser's wish on the Dream Stone to make him vanish from existence), Resistance to Plot Manipulation (After Bowser beat the manga kamen and changed the script, the kamen said Mario would win anyways because he always wins. Sure enough, Mario won), Resistance to Concept Destruction (The Void would erase all concepts, and Mario is completely unaffected by The Void's powers. Why would The Void erase all concepts? With the power of paint, Red could talk telepathically to Mario and Huey by coloring their thoughts. This would mean that paint not only gives life to beings and such, but it is also what embodies and creates thoughts; concepts are defined as thoughts and ideas, so if The Void can erase all existence, including all the paint and Paint Stars, then it's erasing all concepts as well. If you count the 1-A rating below, it can also erase all Universals, which Mario would also resist), Resistance to Meta Wish Granting (Survived Bowser's wish on the Star Rod to destroy him), Resistance to Matter Manipulation (Atomic; can be stripped down to clumps of pixels and then reform completely unharmed), Resistance to Evolution Manipulation (When shot by Bowser's Devolution Gun in Kun, he resisted it, and instead of devolving to a monkey like Luigi did, he gained his Tanooki Mario power-up), Resistance to Fate Manipulation (The Light Prognosticus foretold that the four Heroes of Light would gather together and use the Pure Hearts to defeat The Dark One. The Dark Prognosticus foretold that the hero of prophecy and all others would be stopped by the Green One joining The Dark One, cementing the end of all worlds. These imbalances messed with the wheels of destiny. Everything they wrote became truth; it was fate itself bringing about the actions. But at the end, breaking the Light Prognosticus, Luigi joined Dimentio--The Dark One--and began down the path that the Dark Prognosticus created. The Heroes of Light, however, break the Dark Prognosticus and win anyways. Tippi describes this entire phenomena as "fate," rather cementing the fact that the two Prognosticuses played with fate itself. And in the end, the Heroes of Light and The Dark One all broke both Prognosticuses, giving them a resistance to fate manipulation), Enhanced Swordsmanship (Is greatly skilled in swordplay and fencing), Enhanced Marksmanship (Has held real guns before and has pulled off impressive feats with them), 4th Wall Awareness (Displayed both in-games and in Super Mario-Kun), Resurrection (Resurrection as Undead; it took awhile, but in Super Mario-Kun, Mario was killed, traversed through hell, and came back to life), Pain Affinity (Evidenced here), Regeneration (High-Mid; survived being blown to pieces like a balloon), Duplication (Can sacrifice extra lives for a clone of himself), Resistance to Primordial Force Manipulation (The Player can't affect him at all), Resistance to Universal Manipulation (Can break free from The Player's grip, which reigns over everything else in the game), Proficiency w/ Hammers, Soul Destruction and Mutilation (Has greatly damaged Boos and other ghosts, and has even destroyed Cackletta's Soul), Dimensional Manipulation, Space and Time Manipulation/Time Travel, and Brotherly Telepathy w/ Luigi. Music Manipulation (Anyone who had possession of or was in the same vicinity of a Music Key had the power of music transmitted into their souls, and can tap into its power for a variety of abilities as long as they're skilled enough, including all of the following powers after this one), Mind Control (Waluigi was going to use it to hypnotize anyone who didn't have the same dancing abilities as him), Chaos Inducement (The Music Keys could rain chaos and discord down, destroying everything and everyone), Broadway Force (The second Mario started dancing, things like snowmen, fire itself, plates, and flaming wooden logs started dancing with him), Pyrokinesis (Mario and Luigi's dancing styles are "hot," and can melt things like giant Freezies by generating and shooting fire pretty easily), Telekinesis (Could sail a boat across a river), Summoning (Summoned a rocket from nowhere to attack Bowser), Statistics Amplification (Using the power of dancing, he could increase his speed to catch up to a roller-coaster), Explosion Manipulation (Caused Koopas to explode into music notes), Power Nullification (The Dance Meter essentially decides whose abilities are more effective, and the abilities of the losing dancer are entirely nullified), Matter Manipulation (Molecular; Changed the makeup of a hotel from being a normal building to being a corkscrew, then changed it back), Size Manipulation (Caused a mushroom to spontaneously grow out of the ground), Weather Manipulation (Things like twisters, avalanches, snowstorms and whirlpools were caused by the Keys, as evidenced here), Empathic Manipulation (Forced Bowser to feel happiness. Dancing caused Boos to warm up to Mario), Healing (Bowser was going to use the Keys to fix his tone deafness), Death Inducement (Bowser's use of the Keys turned the landscape into this...), Life Inducement (Before Mario turned it back into this.             </p>

            <h2>Attack Potency</h2>
            <p>
                Multi-Universe level (Mario has beaten dozens of enemies in these levels, including Wart, who put a curse over Subcon 
                and its inhabitants, apparently altering the universe in some way. Wart is also FAR above the likes of Mouser, who can 
                destroy dreams on his own. Then, Bowser threatened the existence of all Mushroom Worlds even after his entire army was 
                demolished and it was just him. With that said, we have one last need: the size of those worlds, and whether or not they're 
                connected. Well, first, considering all the worlds and sub-worlds and mini-worlds are all called worlds are specifically 
                referenced as things like "this world," we can safely reach a conclusion that all worlds--the meta-worlds and even the levels 
                themselves--are separate. And before you say they can't be separate cause you walk to them... this scan with the mini-worlds 
                describes the hands as reaching out of nowhere and taking you to the mini-world. Therefore, it's not illogical to say that the 
                levels are entered through some sort of portal or rift. Finally, their size... first of all, we know they have a star, as World 2's 
                desert level has a Sun. But then we also have the Underworld... which has bottomless pits, making them infinite in size. Now, let's 
                address some arguments against this... first of all, "bottomless pits are common in Mario." Actually, no, they're not. The "bottomless" 
                pits in Mario normally are simply fan-dubbed as bottomless and have never been given statements justifying them as such. Second, 
                "hyperbole." It doesn't make sense for it to be one, really. Underworlds are quite often of actual infinite-size, so it doesn't seem 
                off for this one to be like that as well. With that said, Mario is so powerful in this game, he seen the gap of Ludwig and the other 
                six Koopalings as tiny, even though Ludwig states clearly that he has the power of all the previous Koopalings, plus his own, and is 
                the ultimate Koopaling. Combining all the worlds for the Koopalings into Ludwig's power would make him 77 universes, since all the 
                Koopalings have complete control over the worlds they're in. And since Mario sees that as a tiny gap, it should mean he's at least 10x 
                stronger, making him and Bowser able to destroy 770 universes. But Mario has beaten Bowser in several other games when he had this type 
                of power, too. In Super Mario 64, Bowser created universe-sized realms within the walls and paintings. He had to of created the time in 
                the painting as well, as time and space cannot exist without the other. Further evidenced by how Tick Tock Clock is a world entirely based 
                on time. If he didn't, he'd have Infinite speed for moving in timeless realms. Now, why universe-sized? Because just Bob-omb Battlefield is 
                described by Mario as a parallel world of some sorts when he calls it a world and compares it to the main verse's realm, calling both a world. 
                We also know Bowser made this pretty much instantly. And we know Bowser created these worlds individually, because Toad describes them as Bowser's 
                "separate" worlds. Next up, Shadow Mario polluted and cursed the entirety of Isle Delfino. He also has an amazing amount of knowledge on the Secret 
                Levels, somehow knowing when Mario enters them and where they are all located. There are also cartoony designs within these universes [there being 
                10 of them in totality, possibly more, with four matching the standards and the others scaling] like the train tracks, which provides more evidence 
                Shadow Mario created them. Not to mention the fact that his goop is flowing directly from a Secret Level here, proving his association with them. 
                Because their celestial bodies match ours [Not to mention how those stars are different colors and luminosities, showing clearly that the Doppler 
                Effect is in effect, making those levels expand infinitely—just like our universe. And this is without mentioning that another one of the Secret 
                Levels has enormous clouds out in its space, which is identical to our universe's clouds in space that form galaxies over time. Clearly these are 
                universes, and the infinite voids back it up] and because it's seemingly an infinite void, these are full-blown universes that Shadow Mario created. 
                From scratch, mind you; meaning he also created their space-time continuums. We know he did so in a matter of seconds because there was a live commercial 
                at the start of the game that shows everything hadn't been screwed up yet, and Shadow Mario was in the background, seemingly just arriving. And Mario 
                was literally just about to arrive, meaning that Shadow Mario, somehow, corrupted the entire island and created these levels in a matter of seconds to 
                minutes. Clearly he didn't take his time. Mario has the same physicality as Shadow Mario, thus, scales. And finally, Mario destroyed Megabug and took down 
                Mega Dragon Bowser. The latter is the form the former took after absorbing Spawny [who in turn was merged with the SupaMerge Headset] and Bowser. By absorbing 
                the SupaMerge Headset, the Megabug attained its fusionism powers, which was capable of merging Mario's world and the real world. In the end, Mario has numerous 
                feats in this level and is consistently in these tiers, so this is rather consistent) | Multi-Galaxy level (Darth Koopa revealed that, within a week, he'd conquer 
                and remake the universe into the Koopaverse. Mario had done battle with and defeated Darth Koopa twice) | Multi-Universe level (Killed Koopa. Koopa wanted to merge 
                the Mushroom World with reality, making one large universe out of the two, and then rule over them) | Large Star level (Creates a realm with a star in it and a wide 
                expanse of space around him. Comparable to other captains, like Peach and Diddy Kong, who accomplish the same feat) | High Multiverse level+, likely High Hyperverse 
                level (Fought Bowser during the events of Mario Party 5, where he stated and showed he was going to ruin, or, destroy Dream Depot, and all dreams within it. In Dream 
                Depot, the dreams of the multiverse's denizens are turned into entire universes. Bowser also planned on destroying Future Dream; this dream in particular was stated 
                by Misstar AND by Mario Party 5's guide booklet on page 28 to be an entire universe, meaning each dream is its own universe. With this info, Dream Depot ranges from 
                at least 5-D to infinite-dimensional). Higher w/ the Star Rod (Mario Party) | Multi-Universe level in Super Mario Bros. 2 (Defeated Wart, who conquered Muu once and 
                Subcon twice. The latter is an entire universe, as it is a dream world. After his defeat in BS Super Mario Bros., Subcon, an entire universe, ceases to exist. Wart 
                also put a curse over Subcon and its inhabitants, apparently altering the universe in some way. To add onto this, Wart is FAR above the likes of Mouser, who can 
                destroy dreams on his own. And Mario scales to this). Multi-Universe level in Super Mario Bros. 3 (Bowser threatened the existence of all Mushroom Worlds even 
                after his entire army was demolished and it was just him. With that said, we have one last need: the size of those worlds, and whether or not they're connected. 
                Well, first, considering all the worlds and sub-worlds and mini-worlds are all called worlds are specifically referenced as things like "this world," we can 
                safely reach a conclusion that all worlds--the meta-worlds and even the levels themselves--are separate. And before you say they can't be separate cause you

                has a Sun. But then we also have the Underworld... which has bottomless pits, making them infinite in size. Now, let's address some arguments against this... 
                first of all, "bottomless pits are common in Mario." Actually, no, they're not. The "bottomless" pits in Mario normally are simply fan-dubbed as bottomless and 
                have never been given statements justifying them as such. Second, "hyperbole." It doesn't make sense for it to be one, really. Underworlds are quite often of

                and the other six Koopalings as tiny, even though Ludwig states clearly that he has the power of all the previous Koopalings, and is the ultimate Koopaling. 
                Combining all the worlds for the Koopalings into Ludwig's power would make him 77 universes, since all the Koopalings have complete control over the worlds they're 
                in. And since Mario sees that as a tiny gap, it should mean he's at least 10x stronger, making him and Bowser able to destroy 770 universes). Large Town level+ 
                in Super Mario World (Casually punted Larry's Castle, performing the feat with no visual effort at all) | Multi-Universe level in Super Mario 64 (Mario defeated 
                Bowser even when he was under the effects of the Power Stars, and before amping himself, he created universe-sized realms within the walls and paintings. 
                He had to of created the time in the painting as well, as time and space cannot exist without the other. Further evidenced by how Tick Tock Clock is a world
