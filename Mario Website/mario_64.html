                <h1>What is the Plot of Super Mario 64?</h1>
                <p><em>Super Mario 64</em> is set in Princess Peach's Castle, 
                    which consists of three floors, a basement, a moat, and a 
                    courtyard. The area outside the castle is an introductory 
                    area in which the player can experiment with gameplay, camera, 
                    and movement controls. Scattered throughout the castle are entrances 
                    to courses via secret walls and paintings. <em>Super Mario 64</em> begins 
                    with a letter from Princess Peach inviting Mario to come to her castle for a 
                    cake she has baked for him. When he arrives, Mario discovers that Bowser has invaded
                    the castle and imprisoned the princess and her servants within it using the power of the 
                    castle's 120 Power Stars. Many of the castle's paintings are portals to other worlds, in which 
                    Bowser's minions keep watch over the stars. Mario explores the castle for these portals to enter 
                    the worlds and recover stars. He gains access to more rooms as he recovers more Power Stars, and eventually 
                    traverses three different obstacle corses, each leading to its own battle with Bowser. Defeating Bowser the 
                    first two times earns Mario a key for opening another level of the castle. After Mario defeats Bowser in the 
                    final battle, Peach is released from the stained-glass window above the castle's entrance. Peach rewards mario
                    by kissing him on the nose and baking the cake that she had promised him.</p>
