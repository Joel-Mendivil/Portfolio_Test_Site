                <h1>What is the Plot of Super Mario Sunshine?</h1>
                <p>Mario sets out for Isle Delfino for a vacation with Princess Peach, her long-time 
                    steward Toadsworth, and several other Toads. Upon a rough plane landing at the 
                    island's airstrip, they find out that the once-pristine island has been polluted 
                    and plastered with graffiti. As a result of this pollutionAs a result of this 
                    pollution, sun-shaped objects called "Shine Sprites", the island's sources of 
                    power, have disappeared, and the island is covered in a perpetual shadow. To 
                    help with cleaning the airstrip, Mario finds a Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing 
                    Device or F.L.U.D.D., a powerful water cannon which is toted like a backpack 
                    and is created by Professor E. Gadd. Mario defeats a giant slime covered 
                    Piranha Plant and restores the airstrip, but he is subsequently arrested by 
                    two Pianta police officers who accuse him of vandalizing Isle Delfino with 
                    graffiti, despite the fact that he has only just arrived. He is put on trial, 
                    which turns out to be a mere kangaroo court where the judge immediately 
                    finds Mario guilty (for which clearly he is not) and orders him to clean 
                    up the graffiti and recover the Shine Sprites, in spite of Princess Peach's 
                    objection to the ruling. He is forbidden from leaving the island until he 
                    does so. The next day, after spending the night in a cell, Mario begins his 
                    adventure to find a way to clear his name and locate the real criminal, while 
                    restoring tranquility and order to Isle Delfino.</p>
